== Library Reference

[#ChLibIntro]

=== Introduction

Like most applications, Wireshark depends on libraries provided by your operating system and by third parties, including the C runtime library, GLib, libpcap, and Qt.
While running Wireshark only requires the libraries themselves, building it requires header files, import libraries, and related resources.

Binary libraries are available in different formats and are specific to the target operating system, platform, and compiler.
They can be compiled by hand, but are most often installed as pre-built packages.

On most Linux systems, the required binary and development libraries can be installed using your package manager.
We provide setup scripts that will install the required packages for most distributions.
See <<ChSetupUNIXBuildEnvironmentSetup>> for details.

On macOS, you can install pre-built packages using a third party package manager such as Homebrew or MacPorts.
As with Linux, we provide `tools/macos-setup-brew.sh`, which will install the required Homebrew packages.
We also provide `tools/macos-setup.sh`, which will download, build, and install required packages.
Note that `tools/macos-setup.sh` installs into _/usr/local_ by default; you can change this with the `-p` flag.

Windows doesn't have a good library package manager at the present time, so we provide our own pre-built libraries.
They can be installed using `tools/win-setup.ps1` and are automatically installed when you run CMake.
With the exception of Qt, all libraries required to build Wireshark on Windows are available for download at
https://dev-libs.wireshark.org/windows/[].
See <<ChLibsSetup>> for details.

[#ChLibsSetup]

=== Windows Automated Library Download

The required libraries (apart from Qt) are automatically downloaded as part of
the CMake generation step, and subsequently as required when libraries are updated.

The libraries are downloaded into the directory indicated by the environment
variable WIRESHARK_BASE_DIR, this must be set appropriately for your environment.
The libraries are downloaded and extracted into WIRESHARK_BASE_DIR\wireshark-x64-libs or WIRESHARK_BASE_DIR\wireshark-arm64-libs depending on your target platform.

You may also set the library directory to a custom value with the environment variable WIRESHARK_LIB_DIR, but you may run into problems if you switch between major versions or target platforms.

[#ChLibsQt]

=== Qt

The Qt library is used to build the UI for Wireshark and is used to provide a platform independent UI.
Wireshark can be built with Qt 5.12 or later, but looks for Qt 6 as the default version.

To enable builds with Qt 5.x, the command-line option `-DUSE_qt6=OFF` has to be set for cmake.

For more information on the Qt libraries, see <<ChUIQt>>.

[#ChLibsUnixQt]

[discrete]
==== Unix

Most Linux distributions provide Qt and its development libraries as standard packages.
The required libraries and tools will likely be split across several packages. For example,
building on Ubuntu requires _qt6-tools-dev_, _qt6-tools-dev-tools_, _libqt6svg6-dev_,
_qt6-multimedia-dev_, and possibly others.

The Qt Project provides an installation tool for macOS, similar to Windows.
It is available at https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2[].

[#ChLibsWindowsQt]

[discrete]
==== Windows

Qt 6 must be installed manually from the Qt installers page https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2[] using the version of Qt appropriate for your compiler.

The CMake variable CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH (see `https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/cmake-get-started.html`) should be set to your Qt installation directory, e.g. _C:\Qt{backslash}{qt6-lts-version}\msvc2019_64_.
Alternatively you can also use the environment variable WIRESHARK_QT6_PREFIX_PATH.

[#ChLibsGLib]

=== GLib And Supporting Libraries

The GLib library is used as a basic platform abstraction library and can
be used in both CLI and GUI applications. For a detailed description
about GLib see <<ChCodeGLib>>.

GLib depends on GNU libiconv, GNU gettext, and other libraries. You will
typically not come into contact with these while doing Wireshark
development. Wireshark's build system check for and require both GLib
and its dependencies.

[#ChLibsUnixGLib]

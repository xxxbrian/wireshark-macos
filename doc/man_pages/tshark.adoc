== DESCRIPTION

*TShark* is a network protocol analyzer.  It lets you capture packet
data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved
capture file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the
standard output or writing the packets to a file.  *TShark*'s native
capture file format is *pcapng* format, which is also the format used
by *Wireshark* and various other tools.

Without any options set, *TShark* will work much like *tcpdump*.  It
will use the pcap library to capture traffic from the first available
network interface and displays a summary line on the standard output for
each received packet.

When run with the *-r* option, specifying a capture file from which to
read, *TShark* will again work much like *tcpdump*, reading packets
from the file and displaying a summary line on the standard output for
each packet read.  *TShark* is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by *Wireshark*.  The input file
doesn't need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, zstd or lz4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of xref:wireshark.html[wireshark](1) or
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html is a detailed
description of the way *Wireshark* handles this, which is the same way
*TShark* handles this.

Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present when compiling *TShark*, it will be
possible to compile it, but the resulting program will be unable to read
compressed files.

When displaying packets on the standard output, *TShark* writes, by
default, a summary line containing the fields specified by the
preferences file (which are also the fields displayed in the packet list
pane in *Wireshark*), although if it's writing packets as it captures
them, rather than writing packets from a saved capture file, it won't
show the "frame number" field.  If the *-V* option is specified, it
instead writes a view of the details of the packet, showing all the
fields of all protocols in the packet.  If the *-O* option is
specified, it will only show the full details for the protocols
specified, and show only the top-level detail line for all other
protocols.  Use the output of "*tshark -G protocols*" to find the
abbreviations of the protocols you can specify.  If the *-P* option is
specified with either the *-V* or *-O* options, both the summary line
for the entire packet and the details will be displayed.

Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  That library
supports specifying a filter expression; packets that don't match that
filter are discarded.  The *-f* option is used to specify a capture
filter.  The syntax of a capture filter is defined by the pcap library;
this syntax is different from the display filter syntax described below,
and the filtering mechanism is limited in its abilities.

Display filters in *TShark*, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in *TShark* than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As *TShark* progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
*Wireshark*; a display filter is specified with the *-Y* option.

Display filters can be specified when capturing or when reading from a
capture file.  Note that capture filters are much more efficient
than display filters, and it may be more difficult for *TShark* to keep up
with a busy network if a display filter is specified for a live capture, so
you might be more likely to lose packets if you're using a display filter.

A capture or display filter can either be specified with the *-f* or *-Y*
option, respectively, in which case the entire filter expression must be
specified as a single argument (which means that if it contains spaces,
it must be quoted), or can be specified with command-line arguments
after the option arguments, in which case all the arguments after the
filter arguments are treated as a filter expression.  If the filter is
specified with command-line arguments after the option arguments, it's a
capture filter if a capture is being done (i.e., if no *-r* option was
specified) and a display filter if a capture file is being read (i.e., if a
*-r* option was specified).

If the *-w* option is specified when capturing packets or reading from
a capture file, *TShark* does not display packets on the standard
output.  Instead, it writes the packets to a capture file with the name
specified by the *-w* option.  Note that display filters are currently
not supported when capturing and saving the captured packets.

If you want to write the decoded form of packets to a file, run
*TShark* without the *-w* option, and redirect its standard output to
the file (do __not__ use the *-w* option).

If you want the packets to be displayed to the standard output and also
saved to a file, specify the *-P* option in addition to the *-w*
option to have the summary line displayed, specify the *-V* option
in addition to the *-w* option to have the details of the packet
displayed, and specify the *-O* option, with a list of protocols, to
have the full details of the specified protocols and the top-level
detail line for all other protocols to be displayed.  If the *-P*
option is used together with the *-V* or *-O* option, the summary line
will be displayed along with the detail lines.

When writing packets to a file, *TShark*, by default, writes the file
in *pcapng* format, and writes all of the packets it sees to the output
file.  The *-F* option can be used to specify the format in which to
write the file.  This list of available file formats is displayed by the
*-F* option without a value.  However, for a live capture, you can only
specify a file format supported by xref:dumpcap.html[dumpcap](1), viz.
*pcapng* or *pcap*.

When capturing packets, *TShark* writes to the standard error an
initial line listing the interfaces from which packets are being
captured and, if packet information isn't being displayed to the
terminal, writes a continuous count of packets captured to the standard
output.  If the *-q* option is specified, neither the continuous count
nor the packet information will be displayed; instead, at the end of the
capture, a count of packets captured will be displayed.  If the *-Q*
option is specified, neither the initial line, nor the packet
information, nor any packet counts will be displayed.  If the *-q* or
*-Q* option is used, the *-P*, *-V*, or *-O* option can be used to
cause the corresponding output to be displayed even though other output
is suppressed.

When reading packets, the *-q* and *-Q* option will suppress the
display of the packet summary or details; this would be used if *-z*
options are specified in order to display statistics, so that only the
statistics, not the packet information, is displayed.

The *-G* option is a special mode that simply causes *TShark*
to dump one of several types of internal glossaries and then exit.

== OPTIONS

-2::
+
--
Perform a two-pass analysis. This causes *TShark* to buffer output until the
entire first pass is done, but allows it to fill in fields that require future
knowledge, such as 'response in frame #' fields. Also permits reassembly
frame dependencies to be calculated correctly.
--

-a|--autostop  <capture autostop condition>::
+
--
Specify a criterion that specifies when *TShark* is to stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form __test:value__,
where __test__ is one of:

*duration*:__value__ Stop writing to a capture file after __value__ seconds
have elapsed. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

*files*:__value__ Stop writing to capture files after __value__ number of files
were written.

*filesize*:__value__ Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
__value__ kB.  If this option is used together with the *-b* option, *TShark*
will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if
filesize is reached.  When reading a capture file, *TShark* will stop reading
the file after the number of bytes read exceeds this number (the complete
packet  will be read, so more bytes than this number may be read).  Note that
the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB, although you might have
problems before then if the number of packets exceeds exceeds 2^32^ (4294967296).

*packets*:__value__ switch to the next file after it contains __value__
packets.
This does not include any packets that do not pass the display filter, so it
may differ from *-c*<capture packet count>.
--

-A  <user>:<password>::
+
--
Specify a user and a password when *TShark* captures from a rpcap:// interface
where authentication is required.

This option is available with libpcap with enabled remote support.
--

-b|--ring-buffer  <capture ring buffer option>::
+
--
Cause *TShark* to run in "multiple files" mode.  In "multiple files" mode,
*TShark* will write to several capture files.  When the first capture file
fills up, *TShark* will switch writing to the next file and so on.

The created filenames are based on the filename given with the *-w* option,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,
e.g. outfile_00001_20240714120117.pcap, outfile_00002_20240714120523.pcap, ...

With the __files__ option it's also possible to form a "ring buffer".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point *TShark* will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the __files__ option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).

The criterion is of the form __key:value__,
where __key__ is one of:

*duration*:__value__ switch to the next file after __value__ seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. Floating
point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

*files*:__value__ begin again with the first file after __value__ number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The *files* criterion
requires either *duration*, *interval* or *filesize* to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each *-b*
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criterion, each must be
preceded by the *-b* option.

*filesize*:__value__ switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
__value__ kB.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB,
although you might have problems before then if the number of packets exceeds
exceeds 2^32^ (4294967296).

*interval*:__value__ switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of __value__ seconds.  For example, use 3600 to switch to a new file
every hour on the hour.

*packets*:__value__ switch to the next file after it contains __value__
packets.

*printname*:__filename__ print the name of the most recently written file
to __filename__ after the file is closed. __filename__ can be `stdout` or `-`
for standard output, or `stderr` for standard error.

*nametimenum*:__value__ Choose between two save filename templates.  If
__value__ is 1, make running file number part before start time part; this is
the original and default behaviour (e.g. log_00001_20240714164426.pcap).  If
__value__ is greater than 1, make start time part before running number part
(e.g. log_20210828164426_00001.pcap).  The latter makes alphabetical sorting
order equal to creation time order, and keeps related multiple file sets in
same directory close to each other.

Example: *tshark -b filesize:1000 -b files:5* results in a ring buffer of five
files of size one megabyte each.
--

-B|--buffer-size  <capture buffer size>::
+
--
Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB).  This is used by
the capture driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk.  If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try to increase
this size.  Note that, while *TShark* attempts to set the buffer size
to 2 MiB by default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the
system or interface on which you're capturing might silently limit the
capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.

This is available on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS,
\*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, with libpcap 1.0.0 or later, and on Windows.
It is not available on UNIX-compatible systems with earlier versions of
libpcap.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the *-i* option, it sets the default capture buffer size.
If used after an *-i* option, it sets the capture buffer size for
the interface specified by the last *-i* option occurring before
this option.  If the capture buffer size is not set specifically,
the default capture buffer size is used instead.
--

-c  <capture packet count>::
+
--
Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live
data.
If reading a capture file, set the maximum number of packets to read.
This includes any packets that do not pass the display filter, so it
may differ from *-a packets:*<capture packet count>.
--

-C  <configuration profile>::
+
--
Run with the given configuration profile.
--

-D|--list-interfaces::
+
--
Print a list of the interfaces on which *TShark* can capture, and
exit.  For each network interface, a number and an interface name,
possibly followed by a text description of the interface, is printed.
The interface name or the number can be supplied to the *-i* flag to
specify an interface on which to capture.  The number can be useful on
Windows systems, where the interfaces have long names that usually
contain a GUID.
--

-e  <field>::
+
--
Add a field to the list of fields to display if *-T ek|fields|json|pdml*
is selected.  This option can be used multiple times on the command line.
At least one field must be provided if the *-T fields* option is
selected. Column types may be used prefixed with "_ws.col."

Example: *tshark -T fields -e frame.number -e ip.addr -e udp -e _ws.col.info*

Fields are separated by tab characters by default.  *-E* controls the
format of the printed fields.
Giving a protocol rather than a single field will print the protocol summary
(subtree label) from the packet details as a single field.
If the protocol summary contains only the protocol name
(e.g. "Hypertext Transfer Protocol") then the protocol filter name ("http")
will be printed.
--

-E  <field print option>::
+
--
Set an option controlling the printing of fields when *-T fields* is
selected.

Options are:

*bom=y|n* If *y*, prepend output with the UTF-8 byte order mark
(hexadecimal ef, bb, bf). Defaults to *n*.

*header=y|n* If *y*, print a list of the field names given using *-e*
as the first line of the output; the field name will be separated using
the same character as the field values.  Defaults to *n*.

*separator=/t|/s|*<character> Set the separator character to
use for fields.  If */t* tab will be used (this is the default), if
*/s*, a single space will be used.  Otherwise any character that can be
accepted by the command line as part of the option may be used.

*occurrence=f|l|a* Select which occurrence to use for fields that have
multiple occurrences.  If *f* the first occurrence will be used, if *l*
the last occurrence will be used and if *a* all occurrences will be used
(this is the default).

*aggregator=,|/s|*<character> Set the aggregator character to
use for fields that have multiple occurrences.  If *,* a comma will be used
(this is the default), if */s*, a single space will be used.  Otherwise
any character that can be accepted by the command line as part of the
option may be used.

*quote=d|s|n* Set the quote character to use to surround fields.  *d*
uses double-quotes, *s* single-quotes, *n* no quotes (the default).
If the quote character appears in a field value, it will be escaped
by being duplicated.

*escape=y|n* If *y*, the whitespace control characters (tab, line feed,
carriage return, form feed, and vertical tab) backspace, and the
backslash will be replaced in field values by C-style escapes, e.g.
"\n" for line feed.  If *n*, field value strings will be printed as-is.
Defaults to *y*.
--

-f  <capture filter>::
+
--
Set the capture filter expression.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the *-i* option, it sets the default capture filter expression.
If used after an *-i* option, it sets the capture filter expression for
the interface specified by the last *-i* option occurring before
this option.  If the capture filter expression is not set specifically,
the default capture filter expression is used if provided.

Pre-defined capture filter names, as shown in the GUI menu item Capture->Capture
Filters, can be used by prefixing the argument with "predef:".
Example: *tshark -f "predef:MyPredefinedHostOnlyFilter"*
--

-F  <file format>::
Set the file format of the output capture file written using the *-w*
option.  The output written with the *-w* option is raw packet data, not
text, so there is no *-F* option to request text output.  The option *-F*
without a value will list the available formats. The default is the
*pcapng* format (unless the default has been changed in preferences.)
.

-g::
This option causes the output file(s) to be created with group-read permission
(meaning that the output file(s) can be read by other members of the calling
user's group).

-G  [ <report type> ]::
+
--
The *-G* option will cause *TShark* to dump one of several types of glossaries
and then exit.  If no glossary type is specified, then the *fields* report
will be generated by default; this is deprecated and a future version will
require the report type argument.  The *-G* option must be the first option given.
Using the report type of *help* lists all the current report types.

The available report types include:

--

-h|--help::
Print the version number and options and exit.

-H  <input hosts file>::
+
--
Read a list of entries from a "hosts" file, which will then be written
to a capture file.  Implies *-W n*. Can be called multiple times.

The "hosts" file format is documented at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file).
--

-i|--interface  <capture interface> | -::
+
--
Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.

Network interface names should match one of the names listed in "*tshark
-D*" (described above); a number, as reported by "*tshark -D*", can also
be used.

If no interface is specified, *TShark* searches the list of
interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if there are any
non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non-loopback interfaces.  If there are no interfaces at all,
*TShark* reports an error and doesn't start the capture.

Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or "-" to
read data from the standard input.  On Windows systems, pipe names must be
of the form +"\\.\pipe\+*pipename*".  Data read from pipes must be in
standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same
endianness as the capturing host.

"TCP@<host>:<port>" causes *TShark* to attempt to connect to the
specified port on the specified host and read pcapng or pcap data.

This option can occur multiple times. When capturing from multiple
interfaces, the capture file will be saved in pcapng format.
--

-I|--monitor-mode::
+
--
Put the interface in "monitor mode"; this is supported only on IEEE
802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and supported only on some operating systems.

Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the
network with which it's associated, so that you will not be able to use
any wireless networks with that adapter.  This could prevent accessing
files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses,
if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another
network with another adapter.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the *-i* option, it enables the monitor mode for all interfaces.
If used after an *-i* option, it enables the monitor mode for
the interface specified by the last *-i* option occurring before
this option.
--

-j  <protocol match filter>::
+
--
Protocol match filter used for ek|json|jsonraw|pdml output file types.
Only the protocol's parent node is included. Child nodes are only
included if explicitly specified in the filter.

Example: *tshark -T json -j "ip ip.flags http"*
--

-J  <protocol match filter>::
+
--
Protocol top level filter used for ek|json|jsonraw|pdml output file types.
The protocol's parent node and all child nodes are included.
Lower-level protocols must be explicitly specified in the filter.

Example: *tshark -T pdml -J "tcp http"*
--

-l::
+
--
Flush the standard output after the information for each packet is
printed.  (This is not, strictly speaking, line-buffered if *-V*
was specified; however, it is the same as line-buffered if *-V* wasn't
specified, as only one line is printed for each packet, and, as *-l* is
normally used when piping a live capture to a program or script, so that
output for a packet shows up as soon as the packet is seen and
dissected, it should work just as well as true line-buffering.  We do
this as a workaround for a deficiency in the Microsoft Visual C++ C
library.) This also sets *--update-interval* to 0 ms.

This may be useful when piping the output of *TShark* to another
program, as it means that the program to which the output is piped will
see the dissected data for a packet as soon as *TShark* sees the
packet and generates that output, rather than seeing it only when the
standard output buffer containing that data fills up.
--

-L|--list-data-link-types::
List the data link types supported by the interface and exit.  The reported
link types can be used for the *-y* option.

-o  <preference>:<value>::
+
--
Set a preference value, overriding the default value and any value read
from a preference file.  The argument to the option is a string of the
form __prefname:value__, where __prefname__ is the name of the
preference (which is the same name that would appear in the preference
file), and __value__ is the value to which it should be set.
--

-O  <protocols>::
+
--
Similar to the *-V* option, but causes *TShark* to only show a
detailed view of the comma-separated list of __protocols__ specified, and
show only the top-level detail line for all other protocols, rather than
a detailed view of all protocols.  Use the output of "*tshark -G
 protocols*" to find the abbreviations of the protocols you can specify.
--

-p|--no-promiscuous-mode::
+
--
__Don't__ put the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that the
interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other reason; hence,
*-p* cannot be used to ensure that the only traffic that is captured is
traffic sent to or from the machine on which *TShark* is running,
broadcast traffic, and multicast traffic to addresses received by that
machine.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the *-i* option, no interface will be put into the
promiscuous mode.
If used after an *-i* option, the interface specified by the last *-i*
option occurring before this option will not be put into the
promiscuous mode.
--

-P|--print::
+
--
Decode and display the packet summary or details, even if writing raw
packet data using the *-w* option, and even if packet output is
otherwise suppressed with *-Q*.
--

-q::
+
--
When capturing packets, don't display the continuous count of packets
captured that is normally shown when saving a capture to a file;
instead, just display, at the end of the capture, a count of packets
captured.  On systems that support the SIGINFO signal, such as various
BSDs, you can cause the current count to be displayed by typing your
"status" character (typically control-T, although it
might be set to "disabled" by default on at least some BSDs, so you'd
have to explicitly set it to use it).

When reading a capture file, or when capturing and not saving to a file,
don't print packet information; this is useful if you're using a *-z*
option to calculate statistics and don't want the packet information
printed, just the statistics.
--

-Q::
+
--
When capturing packets, don't display, on the standard error, the
initial message indicating on which interfaces the capture is being
done, the continuous count of packets captured shown when saving a
capture to a file, and the final message giving the count of packets
captured.  Only true errors are displayed on the standard error.

This outputs less than the *-q* option, so the interface name and total
packet count and the end of a capture are not sent to stderr.

When reading a capture file, or when capturing and not saving to a file,
don't print packet information; this is useful if you're using a *-z*
option to calculate statistics and don't want the packet information
printed, just the statistics.
--

-r|--read-file  <infile>::
+
--
Read packet data from __infile__, can be any supported capture file format
(including gzipped files).  It is possible to use named pipes or stdin (-)
here but only with certain (not compressed) capture file formats (in
particular: those that can be read without seeking backwards).
--

-R|--read-filter  <Read filter>::
+
--
Cause the specified filter (which uses the syntax of read/display filters,
rather than that of capture filters) to be applied during the first pass of
analysis. Packets not matching the filter are not considered for future
passes. Only makes sense with multiple passes, see *-2*. For regular filtering
on single-pass dissect see *-Y* instead.

Note that forward-looking fields such as 'response in frame #' cannot be used
with this filter, since they will not have been calculated when this filter is
applied.
--

-s|--snapshot-length  <capture snaplen>::
+
--
Set the default snapshot length to use when capturing live data.
No more than __snaplen__ bytes of each network packet will be read into
memory, or saved to disk.  A value of 0 specifies a snapshot length of
262144, so that the full packet is captured; this is the default.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the *-i* option, it sets the default snapshot length.
If used after an *-i* option, it sets the snapshot length for
the interface specified by the last *-i* option occurring before
this option.  If the snapshot length is not set specifically,
the default snapshot length is used if provided.
--

-S  <separator>::
Set the line separator to be printed between packets.

-T  ek|fields|json|jsonraw|pdml|ps|psml|tabs|text::
+
--
Set the format of the output when viewing decoded packet data.  The
options are one of:

*ek* Newline delimited JSON format for bulk import into Elasticsearch.
It can be used with *-j* or *-J* to specify
which protocols to include or with
*-x* to include raw hex-encoded packet data.
If *-P* is specified it will print the packet summary only, with both
*-P* and *-V* it will print the packet summary and packet details.
If neither *-P* or *-V* are used it will print the packet details only.
Example of usage to import data into Elasticsearch:

  tshark -T ek -j "http tcp ip" -P -V -x -r file.pcap > file.json
  curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" -XPOST http://elasticsearch:9200/_bulk --data-binary "@file.json"

Elastic requires a mapping file to be loaded as template for packets-*
index in order to convert Wireshark types to elastic types. This file
can be auto-generated with the command "tshark -G elastic-mapping". Since
the mapping file can be huge, protocols can be selected by using the option
--elastic-mapping-filter:

  tshark -G elastic-mapping --elastic-mapping-filter ip,udp,dns

*fields* The values of fields specified with the *-e* option, in a
form specified by the *-E* option.  For example,

  tshark -T fields -E separator=, -E quote=d

would generate comma-separated values (CSV) output suitable for importing
into your favorite spreadsheet program.

*json* JSON file format.  It can be used with *-j* or *-J* to specify
which protocols to include or with *-x* option to include
raw hex-encoded packet data.  Example of usage:

  tshark -T json -r file.pcap
  tshark -T json -j "http tcp ip" -x -r file.pcap

*jsonraw* JSON file format including only raw hex-encoded packet data.
It can be used with *-j* or *-J* to specify which protocols to include.
Example of usage:

  tshark -T jsonraw -r file.pcap
  tshark -T jsonraw -j "http tcp ip" -x -r file.pcap

*pdml* Packet Details Markup Language, an XML-based format for the
details of a decoded packet.  This information is equivalent to the
packet details printed with the *-V* option.  Using the *--color* option
will add color attributes to *pdml* output.  These attributes are
nonstandard.

*ps* PostScript for a human-readable one-line summary of each of the
packets, or a multi-line view of the details of each of the packets,
depending on whether the *-V* option was specified.

*psml* Packet Summary Markup Language, an XML-based format for the summary
information of a decoded packet.  This information is equivalent to the
information shown in the one-line summary printed by default.
Using the *--color* option will add color attributes to *pdml* output. These
attributes are nonstandard.

*tabs* Similar to the default *text* report except the human-readable one-line
summary of each packet will include an ASCII horizontal tab (0x09) character
as a delimiter between each column.

*text* Text of a human-readable one-line summary of each of the packets, or a
multi-line view of the details of each of the packets, depending on
whether the *-V* option was specified.  This is the default.
--

--temp-dir <directory>::
+
--
Specifies the directory into which temporary files (including capture
files) are to be written.  The default behavior on UNIX-compatible systems,
such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, is to use the environment
variable __$TMPDIR__ if set, and the system default, typically __/tmp__, if it
is not.  On Windows, the __%TEMP%__ environment variable is used, which
typically defaults to __%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp__.
--

-U <tap name>::
+
--
PDUs export, exports PDUs from infile to outfile according to the tap
name given. Use *-Y* to filter.

Enter an empty tap name "" or a tap name of ? to get a list of available
names.
--

-v|--version::
Print the full version information and exit.

-V::
Cause *TShark* to print a view of the packet details.

-w  <outfile> | -::
+
--
Write raw packet data to __outfile__ or to the standard output if
__outfile__ is '-'.

NOTE: *-w* provides raw packet data, not text.  If you want text output
you need to redirect stdout (e.g. using '>'), don't use the *-w*
option for this.
--

-W  <file format option>::
+
--
Save extra information in the file if the format supports it.  For
example,

  tshark -F pcapng -W n

will save host name resolution records along with captured packets.

Future versions of *TShark* may automatically change the capture format
to *pcapng* as needed.

The argument is a string that may contain the following letter:

*n* write network address resolution information (pcapng only)
--

-x::
Cause *TShark* to print a hex and ASCII dump of the packet data
after printing the summary and/or details, if either are also being displayed.

--hexdump <hexoption>::
+
--
Cause *TShark* to print a hex and ASCII dump of the packet data
with the ability to select which data sources to dump and how to
format or exclude the ASCII dump text.

This option can be used multiple times where the data source *<hexoption>*
is *all* or *frames* and the ASCII dump text *<hexoption>* is *ascii*,
*delimit*, *noascii*.

  Example:  tshark ... --hexdump frames --hexdump delimit ...

*all*::

Enable hexdump, generate hexdump blocks for all data sources associated
with each frame. Used to negate earlier use of `--hexdump frames`.
The *-x* option displays all data sources by default.

*frames*::

Enable hexdump, generate hexdump blocks only for the frame data. Use
this option to exclude, from hexdump output, any hexdump blocks for
secondary data sources such as 'Bitstring tvb', 'Reassembled TCP',
'De-chunked entity body', etc.

*ascii*::

Enable hexdump, with undelimited ASCII dump text. Used to negate earlier
use of `--hexdump delimit` or `--hexdump noascii`. The *-x* option
displays undelimited ASCII dump text by default.

*delimit*::

Enable hexdump with the ASCII dump text delimited with '|' characters.
This is useful to unambiguously determine the last of the hex byte text
and start of the ASCII dump text.

*noascii*::

Enable hexdump without printing any ASCII dump text.

*help*::

Display *--hexdump* specific help then exit.

The use of *--hexdump <hexoption>* is particularly useful to generate output
that can be used to create a pcap or pcapng file from a capture file type such
as Microsoft NetMon 2.x which *TShark* and *Wireshark* can read but can not
directly do a "Save as" nor export packets from.

Examples:

Generate hexdump output, with only the frame data source, with delimited ASCII
dump text, with each frame hex block preceded by a human readable timestamp that
is directly usable by the *text2pcap* utility:

  tshark ... --hexdump frames --hexdump delimit \
      -P -t ad -o gui.column.format:"Time","%t" \
      | text2pcap -n -t '%F %T.%f' - MYNEWPCAPNG

Generate hexdump output, with only the frame data source, with no ASCII dump text,
with each frame hex block preceded by an epoch timestamp that is directly
usable by the *text2pcap* utility:

  tshark ... --hexdump frames --hexdump noascii \
      -P -t e -o gui.column.format:"Time","%t" \
      | text2pcap -n -t %s.%f - MYNEWPCAPNG
--

-X <eXtension options>::
+
--
Specify an option to be passed to a *TShark* module.  The eXtension option
is in the form __extension_key:value__, where __extension_key__ can be:

*lua_script*:__lua_script_filename__ tells *TShark* to load the given script in
addition to the default Lua scripts.

**lua_script**__num__:__argument__ tells *TShark* to pass the given argument
to the lua script identified by 'num', which is the number indexed order of the
'lua_script' command. For example, if only one script was loaded with
'-X lua_script:my.lua', then '-X lua_script1:foo' will pass the string 'foo' to
the 'my.lua' script.  If two scripts were loaded, such as '-X lua_script:my.lua'
and '-X lua_script:other.lua' in that order, then a '-X lua_script2:bar' would
pass the string 'bar' to the second lua script, namely 'other.lua'.

*read_format*:__file_format__ tells *TShark* to use the given file format to
read in the file (the file given in the *-r* command option). Providing no
__file_format__ argument, or an invalid one, will produce a list of available
file formats to use. For example,

  tshark -r rtcp_broken.pcapng -X read_format:"MIME Files Format" -V

will display the internal file structure  and allow access to the
`file-pcapng` fields.
--

-y|--linktype  <capture link type>::
+
--
Set the data link type to use while capturing packets.  The values
reported by *-L* are the values that can be used.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the *-i* option, it sets the default capture link type.
If used after an *-i* option, it sets the capture link type for
the interface specified by the last *-i* option occurring before
this option.  If the capture link type is not set specifically,
the default capture link type is used if provided.
--

-Y|--display-filter  <displaY filter>::
+
--
Cause the specified filter (which uses the syntax of read/display filters,
rather than that of capture filters) to be applied before printing a
decoded form of packets or writing packets to a file.  Packets matching the
filter are printed or written to file; packets that the matching packets
depend upon (e.g., fragments), are not printed but are written to file;
packets not matching the filter nor depended upon are discarded rather
than being printed or written.

Use this instead of *-R* for filtering using single-pass analysis. If doing
two-pass analysis (see *-2*) then only packets matching the read filter (if there
is one) will be checked against this filter.
--

-M  <auto session reset>::
+
--
Automatically reset internal session when reached to specified number of packets.
For example,

    tshark -M 100000

will reset session every 100000 packets.

This feature does not support *-2* two-pass analysis
--

-z  <statistics>::
+
--
Get *TShark* to collect various types of statistics and display the
result after finishing reading the capture file.  Use the *-q* option
if you're reading a capture file and only want the statistics printed,
not any per-packet information.

Statistics are calculated independently of the normal per-packet output,
unaffected by the main display filter. However, most have their own
optional __filter__ parameter, and only packets that match that filter (and
any capture filter or read filter) will be used in the calculations.

Note that the *-z proto* option is different - it doesn't cause
statistics to be gathered and printed when the capture is complete, it
modifies the regular packet summary output to include the values of
fields specified with the option.  Therefore you must not use the *-q*
option, as that option would suppress the printing of the regular packet
summary output, and must also not use the *-V* option, as that would
cause packet detail information rather than packet summary information
to be printed.

Some of the currently implemented statistics are:
--

*-z help*::
Display all possible values for *-z*.

The table is presented with one line for each conversation which displays
the number of frames/bytes in each direction, the total number of
frames/bytes, relative start time and duration.
The table is sorted according to the total number of frames.
--

*-z* credentials::
Collect credentials (username/passwords) from packets. The report includes
the packet number, the protocol that had that credential, the username and
the password. For protocols just using one single field as authentication,
this is provided as a password and a placeholder in place of the user.
Currently implemented protocols include FTP, HTTP, IMAP, POP, and SMTP.

*-z* dcerpc,srt,__uuid__,__major__.__minor__[,__filter__]::
+
--
Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for DCERPC interface __uuid__,
version __major__.__minor__.
Data collected is the number of calls for each procedure, MinSRT, MaxSRT
and AvgSRT.

Example: [.nowrap]#*-z dcerpc,srt,12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ac,1.0*# will
collect data for the CIFS SAMR Interface.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

Example: [.nowrap]#*-z dcerpc,srt,12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ac,1.0,ip.addr==1.2.3.4*# will collect SAMR

--

*-z* dests,tree[,__filter__]::
Calculate statistics on IPv4 destination addresses and the protocols
and ports appearing on each address.

*-z* dhcp,stat[,__filter__]::
Show DHCP (BOOTP) statistics.

*-z* diameter,avp[,__cmd.code__,__field__,__field__,__...__]::
+
--
This option enables extraction of most important diameter fields from large
capture files. Exactly one text line for each diameter message with matched
*diameter.cmd.code* will be printed.

Empty diameter command code or +'*'+ can be specified to match any *diameter.cmd.code*

Example: *-z diameter,avp*  extract default field set from diameter messages.

Example: *-z diameter,avp,280*  extract default field set from diameter DWR messages.

Example: *-z diameter,avp,272*  extract default field set from diameter CC messages.

Extract most important fields from diameter CC messages:

*tshark -r file.cap.gz -q -z diameter,avp,272,CC-Request-Type,CC-Request-Number,Session-Id,Subscription-Id-Data,Rating-Group,Result-Code*

Following fields will be printed out for each diameter message:

  "req_frame"    Number of frame where matched request was found or '0'.
  "ans_frame"    Number of frame where matched answer was found or '0'.
  "resp_time"    response time in seconds, '0' in case if matched Request/Answer is not found in trace.  E.g. in the begin or end of capture.

*-z diameter,avp* option is much faster than *-V -T text* or *-T pdml* options.

*-z diameter,avp* option is more powerful than *-T field* and *-z proto,colinfo* options.

Multiple diameter messages in one frame are supported.

Several fields with same name within one diameter message are supported, e.g.
__diameter.Subscription-Id-Data__ or __diameter.Rating-Group__.

Note: *tshark -q* option is recommended to suppress default *TShark* output.
--

*-z* diameter,srt[,__filter__]::
Collect requests/response SRT (Service Response Time) data for Diameter.
Data collected is number of request and response pairs of each Diameter
command code, Minimum SRT, Maximum SRT, Average SRT, and Sum SRT.
Currently no statistics are gathered on unpaired messages.

*-z* dns,tree[,__filter__]::

such as qtype and qclass distribution. For some data (as qname length or DNS
payload) max, min and average values are also displayed.

*-z* endpoints,__type__[,__filter__]::
+
--

  "zbee_nwk"  ZigBee Network Layer addresses

The table is presented with one line for each endpoint which displays
the total number of packets/bytes and the number of packets/bytes in
each direction.
The table is sorted according to the total number of packets.
--

*-z* enrp,stat[,__filter__]::
Calculate statistics on Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol (ENRP).
For each message type, displays the number, rate, and share among
all message types of both packets and bytes, and the first and last
time that it is seen.

*-z* expert[__,error|,warn|,note|,chat|,comment__][,__filter__]::
+
--
Collects information about all expert info, and will display them in order,
grouped by severity.

Example: *-z expert,sip* will show expert items of all severity for frames that
match the sip protocol.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

Example: *-z "expert,note,tcp"* will only collect expert items for frames that
include the tcp protocol, with a severity of note or higher.
--

*-z* f1ap,tree[,__filter__]::
Calculate the distribution of F1AP packets, grouped by packet types.

*-z* f5_tmm_dist,tree[,__filter__]::
Calculate the F5 Ethernet trailer Traffic Management Microkernel distribution.
Displayed information is the number of packets and bytes, grouped by the TMM
slot and number, whether packets are ingress or egress, and whether there is
a flow ID and virtual server name, a flow ID without virtual server name, or
no flow ID, along with total for all packets with F5 trailers.

*-z* f5_virt_dist,tree[,__filter__]::
Calculate F5 Ethernet trailer Virtual Server distribution.
Displayed information is the number of packets and bytes, grouped by the
virtual server name if it exists, or by whether there is a flow ID or not
if there is no virtual server name, as well as totals for all packets with
F5 trailers.

*-z* fc,srt[,__filter__]::
Collect requests/response SRT (Service Response Time) data for GTP.
Data collected is the number of request/response pairs, minimum SRT,
maximum SRT, average SRT, and sum SRT for each value of the Type field
(next protocol).  No statistics are gathered on unpaired messages.

*-z* flow,__name__,__mode__[,__filter__]::
+
--
Displays the flow of data between two nodes. Output is the same as ASCII format
saved from GUI.

__name__ specifies the flow name.  It can be one of:

  any      All frames
  icmp     ICMP
  icmpv6   ICMPv6
  lbm_uim  UIM
  tcp      TCP

__mode__ specifies the address type.  It can be one of:

  standard   Any address
  network    Network address

Example: *-z flow,tcp,network* will show data flow for all TCP frames
--

*-z* follow,__prot__,__mode__,__filter__[,__range__]::
+
--
Displays the contents of a TCP or UDP stream between two nodes. The data
sent by the second node is prefixed with a tab to differentiate it from the
data sent by the first node.

__prot__ specifies the transport protocol.  It can be one of:

  tcp   TCP
  udp   UDP
  dccp  DCCP
  tls   TLS or SSL
  http  HTTP streams
  http2 HTTP/2 streams
  quic  QUIC streams

NOTE: While the usage help presents sip as an option, the proper
stream filters are not implemented so SIP calls cannot be followed
in *TShark*, only in *Wireshark*.

__mode__ specifies the output mode.  It can be one of:

  ascii  ASCII output with dots for non-printable characters
  ebcdic EBCDIC output with dots for non-printable characters
  hex    Hexadecimal and ASCII data with offsets
  raw    Hexadecimal data
  utf-8  UTF-8 output with REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs for invalid sequences
  yaml   YAML format

Since the output in *ascii*, *ebcdic*, or *utf-8* mode may contain newlines,
each section of output is preceded by its length in bytes plus a newline.
(Note that for *utf-8* this is not UTF-8 characters, and may be different
than the length as transmitted due to the substitution of replacement
characters for invalid sequences.)

__filter__ specifies the stream to be displayed. There are three formats:

  ip-addr0:port0,ip-addr1:port1
  stream-index
  stream-index,substream-index

The first format specifies IP addresses and TCP, UDP, or DCCP port pairs.
(TCP ports are used for TLS, HTTP, and HTTP2; QUIC does not support address
and port matching because of connection migration.)

The second format specifies stream indices, and is used for TCP, UDP, DCCP,
TLS, and HTTP. (TLS and HTTP use TCP stream indices.)

The third format, specifying streams and substreams, is used for HTTP/2 and
QUIC due to their use of multiplexing. (TCP stream and HTTP/2 stream indices
for HTTP/2, QUIC connection number and stream ID for QUIC.)

__range__ optionally specifies which "chunks" of the stream should be displayed.

Example: *-z "follow,tcp,hex,1"* will display the contents of the second TCP
stream (the first is stream 0) in "hex" format.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.
--

*-z* io,stat,__interval__[,__filter__][,__filter__][,__filter__]...::
+
--
Collect packet/bytes statistics for the capture in intervals of
__interval__ seconds.  __Interval__ can be specified either as a whole or
fractional second and can be specified with microsecond (us) resolution.
If __interval__ is 0, the statistics will be calculated over all packets.

If one or more __filters__ are specified statistics will be calculated for
all filters and presented with one column of statistics for each filter.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

Example: *-z io,stat,1,ip.addr==1.2.3.4* will generate 1 second
statistics for all traffic to/from host 1.2.3.4.

Example: *-z "io,stat,0.001,smb&&ip.addr==1.2.3.4"* will generate 1ms
statistics for all SMB packets to/from host 1.2.3.4.

The examples above all use the standard syntax for generating statistics
which only calculates the number of packets and bytes in each interval.

*io,stat* can also do much more statistics and calculate COUNT(), SUM(),
MIN(), MAX(), AVG() and LOAD() using a slightly different filter syntax:
--

-z io,stat,__interval__,"COUNT|SUM|MIN|MAX|AVG|LOAD(__field__)__filter__"::
+
--
NOTE: One important thing to note here is that the filter is not optional
and that the field that the calculation is based on MUST be part of the filter
string or the calculation will fail.

So: *-z io,stat,0.010,AVG(smb.time)* does not work.  Use *-z
 io,stat,0.010,AVG(smb.time)smb.time* instead.  Also be aware that a field
can exist multiple times inside the same packet and will then be counted
multiple times in those packets.

NOTE: A second important thing to note is that the system setting for
decimal separator must be set to "."! If it is set to "," the statistics
will not be displayed per filter.

**COUNT** - Calculates the number of times that the
field __name__ (not its value) appears per interval in the filtered packet list.
''__field__'' can be any display filter name.

Example: *-z io,stat,0.010,"COUNT(smb.sid)smb.sid"*

This will count the total number of SIDs seen in each 10ms interval.

**SUM** - Unlike COUNT, the __values__ of the
specified field are summed per time interval.
''__field__'' can only be a named integer, float, double or relative time field.

Example: *tshark -z io,stat,0.010,"SUM(frame.len)frame.len"*

Reports the total number of bytes that were transmitted bidirectionally in
all the packets within a 10 millisecond interval.

**MIN/MAX/AVG** - The minimum, maximum, or average field value
in each interval is calculated.  The specified field must be a named integer,
float, double or relative time field.  For relative time fields, the output is
presented in seconds with six decimal digits of precision rounded to the nearest
microsecond.

In the following example, the time of the first Read_AndX call, the last Read_AndX
response values are displayed and the minimum, maximum, and average Read response times
(SRTs) are calculated.  NOTE: If the DOS command shell line continuation character, ''^''
is used, each line cannot end in a comma so it is placed at the beginning of each
continuation line:

Calculate statistics for the OSmux voice/signaling multiplex protocol.
Displays the total number of OSmux packets, and displays for each stream
the number of packets, number of packets with the RTP market bit set,
number of AMR frames, jitter analysis, and sequence number analysis.

*-z* pfcp,srt[,__filter__]::
Collect requests/response SRT (Service Response Time) data for PFCP.
Data collected is the number of calls, minimum SRT, maximum SRT, average
SRT, and sum SRT for certain commands.  Currently no statistics are gathered
on unpaired messages.

*-z* pingpongprotocol,stat[,__filter__]::
Calculate statistics on the Ping Pong Protocol of Reliable
Server Pooling.  For each message type, displays the number, rate
and share among all message types of both packets and bytes, and the
first and last time that it is seen.

*-z* plen,tree[,__filter__]::
Calculate statistics on packet lengths. Packets are grouped into buckets
that grow exponentially with powers of two.

*-z* proto,colinfo,__filter__,__field__::
+
--
Append all __field__ values for the packet to the Info column of the
one-line summary output.
This feature can be used to append arbitrary fields to the Info column
in addition to the normal content of that column.
__field__ is the display-filter name of a field which value should be placed
in the Info column.
__filter__ is a filter string that controls for which packets the field value
will be presented in the info column.  __field__ will only be presented in the
Info column for the packets which match __filter__.

NOTE: In order for *TShark* to be able to extract the __field__ value
from the packet, __field__ MUST be part of the __filter__ string.  If not,
*TShark* will not be able to extract its value.

For a simple example to add the "nfs.fh.hash" field to the Info column
for all packets containing the "nfs.fh.hash" field, use

*-z proto,colinfo,nfs.fh.hash,nfs.fh.hash*

To put "nfs.fh.hash" in the Info column but only for packets coming from
host 1.2.3.4 use:

*-z "proto,colinfo,nfs.fh.hash && ip.src==1.2.3.4,nfs.fh.hash"*

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.
--

*-z* ptype,tree[,__filter__]::

AvgSRT, and the total time taken for each procedure.

Example: *tshark -z rpc,srt,100003,3* will collect data for NFS v3.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

Example: *-z rpc,srt,100003,3,nfs.fh.hash==0x12345678* will collect NFS v3
SRT statistics for a specific file.
--

*-z* rtp,streams::

Commandsets are 0:SBC   1:SSC  5:MMC

Data collected
is the number of calls for each procedure, MinSRT, MaxSRT and AvgSRT.

Example: *-z scsi,srt,0* will collect data for SCSI BLOCK COMMANDS (SBC).

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

Example: *-z scsi,srt,0,ip.addr==1.2.3.4* will collect SCSI SBC
SRT statistics for a specific iscsi/ifcp/fcip host.
--

*-z* sctp,stat::
Activate a counter for SCTP chunks. In addition to the total number of
SCTP packets, for each source and destination address and port combination
the number of chunks of the most common types (DATA, SACK, HEARTBEAT,
HEARTBEAT ACK, INIT, INIT ACK, COOKIE ECHO, COOKIE ACK, ABORT, and ERROR)
are displayed.

*-z* sip,stat[,__filter__]::
+
--
This option will activate a counter for SIP messages.  You will get the number
of occurrences of each SIP Method and of each SIP Status-Code.  Additionally
you also get the number of resent SIP Messages (only for SIP over UDP).

Example: *-z sip,stat*.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

Example: *-z "sip,stat,ip.addr==1.2.3.4"* will only collect stats for
SIP packets exchanged by the host at IP address 1.2.3.4 .
--

*-z* smb,sids::
+
--
When this feature is used *TShark* will print a report with all the
discovered SID and account name mappings.  Only those SIDs where the
account name is known will be presented in the table.

For this feature to work you will need to either to enable
"Edit/Preferences/Protocols/SMB/Snoop SID to name mappings" in the
preferences or you can override the preferences by specifying
[.nowrap]#*-o "smb.sid_name_snooping:TRUE"*# on the *TShark* command line.

The current method used by *TShark* to find the SID->name mapping
is relatively restricted with a hope of future expansion.
--

*-z* smb,srt[,__filter__]::
+
--
Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for SMB.  Data collected
is number of calls for each SMB command, MinSRT, MaxSRT and AvgSRT.

Example: *-z smb,srt*

The data will be presented as separate tables for all normal SMB commands,
all Transaction2 commands and all NT Transaction commands.
Only those commands that are seen in the capture will have its stats
displayed.
Only the first command in a xAndX command chain will be used in the
calculation.  So for common SessionSetupAndX + TreeConnectAndX chains,
only the SessionSetupAndX call will be used in the statistics.
This is a flaw that might be fixed in the future.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

Example: *-z "smb,srt,ip.addr==1.2.3.4"* will only collect stats for
SMB packets exchanged by the host at IP address 1.2.3.4 .
--

*-z* smb2,srt[,__filter__]::
Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for SMB versions 2 and 3.
The data collected for each normal command type is the number of calls,
MinSRT, MaxSRT, AvgSRT, and SumSRT.  No data is collected on cancel or
oplock break requests, or on unpaired commands.  Only the first response to
a given request is used; retransmissions are not included in the calculation.

*-z* smpp_commands,tree[,__filter__]::
Calculate the SMPP command distribution. Displayed values are
command IDs for both requests and responses, and status for responses.

*-z* snmp,srt[,__filter__]::
Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for SNMP. The data
collected for each PDU type is the number of request/response pairs,
MinSRT, MaxSRT, AvgSRT, and SumSRT.  No data is collected on unpaired
messages.

*-z*  someip_messages,tree[,__filter__]::
Create statistic of SOME/IP messages. Messages are counted and displayed
as Messages grouped by sender/receiver.

*-z*  someipsd_entries,tree[,__filter__]::
Create statistic of SOME/IP-SD entries. Entries are counted and displayed
as Entries grouped by sender/receiver.

*-z* sv::

operation types for both operations and results, and whether results are
positive or negative, with error codes displayed for negative results.

*-z* wsp,stat[,__filter__]::
Count the PDU types and the status codes of reply packets for WSP packets.

--capture-comment <comment>::
+
--
Add a capture comment to the output file, if supported by the output
file format.

This option may be specified multiple times.  Note that Wireshark
currently only displays the first comment of a capture file.
--

--list-time-stamp-types::
List time stamp types supported for the interface. If no time stamp type can be
set, no time stamp types are listed.

--time-stamp-type <type>::
Change the interface's timestamp method.

--update-interval  <interval>::
Set the length of time in milliseconds between new packet reports during
a capture. Also sets the granularity of file duration conditions.
The default value is 100ms.

--color::
Enable coloring of packets according to standard Wireshark color
filters. On Windows colors are limited to the standard console
character attribute colors. Other platforms require a terminal that
handles 24-bit "true color" terminal escape sequences. See
{wireshark-wiki-url}ColoringRules for more information on
configuring color filters.

--no-duplicate-keys::
If a key appears multiple times in an object, only write it a single time with
as value a json array containing all the separate values. (Only works with
*-T json*)

--elastic-mapping-filter <protocol>,<protocol>,...::
+
--
When generating the ElasticSearch mapping file, only put the specified protocols
in it, to avoid a huge mapping file that can choke some software (such as Kibana).
The option takes a list of wanted protocol abbreviations, separated by comma.

Example: ip,udp,dns puts only those three protocols in the mapping file.
--

--export-objects <protocol>,<destdir>::
+
--
Export all objects within a protocol into directory *destdir*. The available
values for *protocol* can be listed with *--export-objects help*.

The objects are directly saved in the given directory. Filenames are dependent
on the dissector, but typically it is named after the basename of a file.
Duplicate files are not overwritten, instead an increasing number is appended
before the file extension.

This interface is subject to change, adding the possibility to filter on files.
--

--print-timers::
Output JSON containing elapsed times for each pass tshark does to process a capture
file and the sum elapsed time for all passes. The per-pass output contains the total
elapsed time and aggregate counters for per-packet operations (dissection and filtering).

== CAPTURE FILTER SYNTAX

See the manual page of xref:https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap-filter.7.html[pcap-filter](7) or, if that doesn't exist, xref:https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/tcpdump.1.html[tcpdump](8),
or, if that doesn't exist, {wireshark-wiki-url}CaptureFilters.

== READ FILTER SYNTAX

For a complete table of protocol and protocol fields that are filterable
in *TShark* see the xref:wireshark-filter.html[wireshark-filter](4) manual page.

include::files.adoc[tags=**;!gui]

== OUTPUT

*TShark* uses UTF-8 to represent strings internally. In some cases the
output might not be valid. For example, a dissector might generate
invalid UTF-8 character sequences. Programs reading *TShark* output
should expect UTF-8 and be prepared for invalid output.

If *TShark* detects that it is writing to a TTY on a UNIX-compatible
system, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, and the locale
does not support UTF-8, output will be re-encoded to match the current
locale.

If *TShark* detects that it is writing to the console on Windows,
dissection output will be encoded as UTF-16LE. Other output will be
UTF-8. If extended characters don't display properly in your terminal
you might try setting your console code page to UTF-8 (*chcp 65001*)
and using a modern terminal application if possible.

== ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

// Should this be moved to an include file?

WIRESHARK_CONFIG_DIR::
This environment variable overrides the location of personal
configuration files.  On UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS,
\*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, it defaults to __$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark__
(or, if that directory doesn't exist but __$HOME/.wireshark__ does
exist, __$HOME/.wireshark__); this is typically
__$HOME/.config/wireshark__.  On Windows, it defaults to
__%APPDATA%\Wireshark__ (or, if %APPDATA% isn't defined,
__%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Wireshark__).  Available since
Wireshark 3.0.

WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE::
Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the
specified allocator backend for *all* allocations, regardless of which
backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly useful to developers
when testing or debugging. See __README.wmem__ in the source distribution for
details.

WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY::
This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be
loaded from the build directory (where the program was compiled) rather
than from the standard locations.  It has no effect when the program in
question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on UNIX-compatible
systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX.

WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR::
This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
UNIX-compatible systems.

WIRESHARK_EXTCAP_DIR::
This environment variable causes the various extcap programs and scripts
to be run from a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no
effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.

WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_DIR::
This environment variable causes the various plugins to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
UNIX-compatible systems.

ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK::
This environment variable controls the number of ERF records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the ERF format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.

IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK::
This environment variable controls the number of IPFIX records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the IPFIX format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.

WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG::
If this environment variable is set, *TShark* will call abort(3)
when a dissector bug is encountered.  abort(3) will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running *TShark* in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.

WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS::
If this environment variable is set, *TShark* will call abort(3)
if a dissector tries to add too many items to a tree (generally this
is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon enough).
abort(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running
*TShark* in a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow
inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in a debugger,
it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
generate a core dump file.  This can be useful to developers attempting to
troubleshoot a problem with a protocol dissector.

WIRESHARK_LOG_LEVEL::
This environment variable controls the verbosity of diagnostic messages to
the console. From less verbose to most verbose levels can be `critical`,
`warning`, `message`, `info`, `debug` or `noisy`. Levels above the
current level are also active. Levels `critical` and `error` are always
active.

WIRESHARK_LOG_FATAL::
Sets the fatal log level. Fatal log levels cause the program to abort.
This level can be set to `Error`, `critical` or `warning`. `Error` is
always fatal and is the default.

WIRESHARK_LOG_DOMAINS::
This environment variable selects which log domains are active. The filter is
given as a case-insensitive comma separated list. If set only the included
domains will be enabled. The default domain is always considered to be enabled.
Domain filter lists can be preceded by '!' to invert the sense of the match.

WIRESHARK_LOG_DEBUG::
List of domains with `debug` log level. This sets the level of the provided
log domains and takes precedence over the active domains filter. If preceded
by '!' this disables the `debug` level instead.

WIRESHARK_LOG_NOISY::
Same as above but for `noisy` log level instead.
